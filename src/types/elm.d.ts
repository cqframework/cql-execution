The Equal operator returns true if the arguments are equal; false if the arguments are known unequal, and null otherwise. Equality semantics are defined to be value-based.
For simple types, this means that equality returns true if and only if the result of each argument evaluates to the same value.
For string values, equality is strictly lexical based on the Unicode values for the individual characters in the strings.
For decimal values, trailing zeroes are ignored.
For quantities, this means that the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of 'cm' and 'm' are comparable, but units of 'cm2' and 'cm' are not. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in null. When a quantity has no units specified, it is treated as a quantity with the default unit ('1').
For time-valued quantities, UCUM definite-time duration quantities above days (and weeks) are not comparable to calendar duration quantities above days (and weeks). Definite-time duration unit conversions shall be performed as specified in ISO-8601, while calendar-time duration unit conversions shall be performed according to calendar duration semantics. In particular, unit conversion between variable length calendar durations (i.e. years and months) and definite-time durations (i.e. days or below) results in null.
For ratios, this means that the numerator and denominator must be the same, using quantity equality semantics.
For tuple types, this means that equality returns true if and only if the tuples are of the same type, and the values for all elements that have values, by name, are equal.
For list types, this means that equality returns true if and only if the lists contain elements of the same type, have the same number of elements, and for each element in the lists, in order, the elements are equal using equality semantics, with the exception that null elements are considered equal.
For interval types, equality returns true if and only if the intervals are over the same point type, and they have the same value for the starting and ending points of the interval as determined by the Start and End operators.
For Date, Time, and DateTime values, the comparison is performed by considering each precision in order, beginning with years (or hours for time values). If the values are the same, comparison proceeds to the next precision; if the values are different, the comparison stops and the result is false. If one input has a value for the precision and the other does not, the comparison stops and the result is null; if neither input has a value for the precision or the last precision has been reached, the comparison stops and the result is true. For the purposes of comparison, seconds and milliseconds are combined as a single precision using a decimal, with decimal equality semantics.

The Equivalent operator returns true if the arguments are the same value, or if they are both null; and false otherwise.
With the exception of null behavior and the semantics for specific types defined below, equivalence is the same as equality.
For string values, equivalence returns true if the strings are the same value while ignoring case and locale, and normalizing whitespace. Normalizing whitespace means that all whitespace characters are treated as equivalent, with whitespace characters as defined in the whitespace lexical category.
For decimals, equivalent means the values are the same with the comparison done on values rounded to the least precision of the least precise operand; trailing zeroes after the decimal are ignored in determining precision for equivalent comparison.
For quantities, equivalent means the values are the same quantity when considering unit conversion (e.g. 100 'cm' ~ 1 'm') and using decimal equivalent semantics for the value. Note that implementations are not required to support unit conversion and so are allowed to return false for equivalence of quantities with different units.
For time-valued quantities, UCUM definite-time duration quantities above days (and weeks) are considered equivalent to their calendar duration counterparts. Definite-time duration unit conversions shall be performed as specified in ISO-8601, while calendar-time duration unit conversions shall be performed according to the calendar duration semantics. In particular, unit conversion between variable length calendar durations (i.e. years and months) and definite-time durations (i.e. days or below) uses the approximations of 365 days in a year, and 30 days in a month.
For ratios, equivalent means that the numerator and denominator represent the same ratio (e.g. 1:100 ~ 10:1000).
For tuple types, this means that two tuple values are equivalent if and only if the tuples are of the same type, and the values for all elements by name are equivalent.
For list types, this means that two lists are equivalent if and only if the lists contain elements of the same type, have the same number of elements, and for each element in the lists, in order, the elements are equivalent.
For interval types, this means that two intervals are equivalent if and only if the intervals are over the same point type, and the starting and ending points of the intervals as determined by the Start and End operators are equivalent.
For Date, Time, and DateTime values, the comparison is performed in the same way as it is for equality, except that if one input has a value for a given precision and the other does not, the comparison stops and the result is false, rather than null. As with equality, the second and millisecond precisions are combined as a single precision using a decimal, with decimal equivalence semantics.
For Code values, equivalence is defined based on the code and system elements only. The display and version elements are ignored for the purposes of determining Code equivalence.
For Concept values, equivalence is defined as a non-empty intersection of the codes in each Concept.
Note that this operator will always return true or false, even if either or both of its arguments are null or contain null components.

The Collapse operator returns the unique set of intervals that completely covers the ranges present in the given list of intervals. In other words, adjacent intervals within a sorted list are merged if they either overlap or meet.
The operation is performed by combining successive intervals in the input that either overlap or meet, using the semantics defined for the Overlaps and Meets operators. Note that because those operators are themselves defined in terms of interval successor and predecessor operators, sets of Date-, DateTime-, or Time-based intervals that are only defined to a particular precision will calculate meets and overlaps at that precision. For example, a list of DateTime-based intervals where the boundaries are all specified to the hour will collapse at the hour precision, unless the collapse precision is overridden with the per argument.
The per argument determines the precision at which the collapse is computed and must be a quantity-valued expression compatible with the interval point type. For numeric intervals, this means a quantity with the default unit '1' (not to be confused with the quantity value, which may be any valid positive decimal). For Date-, DateTime-, and Time-valued intervals, this means a quantity with a temporal unit (e.g., 'year', 'month', etc).
Conceptually, the per argument to the collapse operator partitions the value-space for the operation into units of size 'per', and the intervals will be collapsed aligning with those partitions. Note that the 'per' partitions start from the starting boundary of the first input interval, ordered.
If the per argument is null, a per value will be constructed based on the coarsest precision of the boundaries of the intervals in the input set. For example, a list of DateTime-based intervals where the boundaries are a mixture of hours and minutes will collapse at the hour precision.
If the list of intervals is empty, the result is empty. If the list of intervals contains a single interval, the result is a list with that interval. If the list of intervals contains nulls, they will be excluded from the resulting list.
